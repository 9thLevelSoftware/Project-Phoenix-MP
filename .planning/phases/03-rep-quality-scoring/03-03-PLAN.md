<objective>
Enhance the set summary with quality metrics (average/best/worst, trend sparkline, radar chart) and define Form Master badges for quality achievements.

Purpose: Users see actionable quality feedback after completing a set, and can earn badges for consistent form.
Output: Enhanced SetSummaryCard with quality section, Form Master badge definitions.

    1. In Models.kt, extend WorkoutState.SetSummary with quality fields:
       - `val qualitySummary: SetQualitySummary? = null` (null for Free tier or if scorer wasn't active)
       Import SetQualitySummary from domain.model.RepQuality.

    2. In ActiveSessionEngine.handleSetCompletion():
       - BEFORE calling `coordinator.repQualityScorer.reset()`, capture the quality summary:
         ```
         val qualitySummary = coordinator.repQualityScorer.getSetSummary()
         ```
       - Pass `qualitySummary` to the SetSummary constructor when building the summary object.
       - Only include quality data if FeatureGate.isEnabled(Feature.REP_QUALITY_SCORE, currentTier) -- pass null otherwise.
       - Get the current tier from settingsManager or wherever it's accessible (check how LED biofeedback does it in 02-02).
       - THEN reset the scorer after capturing the summary.

    3. Verify the SetSummary changes don't break any existing code that creates SetSummary instances (search for `SetSummary(` across the codebase). The new field has a default value so existing call sites should be fine.

  <name>Task 2: Add quality section to SetSummaryCard with sparkline and radar chart</name>

  </files>
  <action>
    Add a quality stats section to SetSummaryCard that appears when `summary.qualitySummary != null`:

    1. QualityStatsSection composable (inside SetSummaryCard.kt or a new file if card is already large):
       - Header: "Rep Quality" with trend indicator icon (arrow up = improving, horizontal = stable, arrow down = declining)
       - Stats row: Average score (large, color-coded), Best rep (#N: score), Worst rep (#N: score)
       - Mini sparkline: A simple Canvas-drawn line chart showing each rep's quality score.
         Implementation: Canvas with drawLine connecting points. X = rep index evenly spaced, Y = score mapped from 0-100 to canvas height. Line color follows gradient (same color scale as HUD indicator). Keep it small (~60dp height, full width).
       - Trend label: "Improving" / "Stable" / "Declining" with corresponding color (green/gray/red)

    2. Radar chart section (swipeable):
       - Use a HorizontalPager (or simple swipe detection with AnimatedContent) to flip between stats view and radar view.
       - Per user decision: "swipe gesture to flip between stats view and radar view"
       - Radar/spider chart: Canvas-drawn pentagon (4 axes: ROM, Velocity, Eccentric, Smoothness).
         Each axis goes from center (0) to edge (max points for that component: 30, 25, 25, 20).
         Plot the AVERAGE component scores across all reps in the set.
         Fill the polygon with semi-transparent green, outline with solid green.
         Label each axis with the component name and score.
       - If HorizontalPager is not available in the current Compose version, use a simple `var showRadar by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }` with a tap/swipe toggle and AnimatedContent.

    3. Component improvement tip (per user decision: "weakest component highlighted with brief improvement tip"):
       - Identify the weakest component by comparing each component's score as a percentage of its max (e.g., rom/30, velocity/25, etc.)
       - Show a brief tip based on weakest component:
         - ROM: "Try to maintain consistent range of motion each rep"
         - Velocity: "Keep a steady tempo throughout the set"
         - Eccentric: "Focus on a controlled 2-second lowering phase"
         - Smoothness: "Avoid jerky movements -- smooth and steady wins"

    4. Place the QualityStatsSection after the existing metrics section in SetSummaryCard, before the RPE section.
       Only render when `summary.qualitySummary != null` (already tier-gated from Task 1).

  <name>Task 3: Define Form Master badges for quality achievements</name>
  <files>
    shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/devil/phoenixproject/domain/model/Gamification.kt
  </files>
  <action>
    1. Add a new BadgeRequirement subclass for quality streaks:
       ```kotlin
       /** Consecutive sets with quality score above threshold */
       data class QualityStreak(val sets: Int, val minScore: Int) : BadgeRequirement()
       ```

    2. Add "Form Master" to BadgeCategory (or use existing CONSISTENCY category -- use CONSISTENCY since quality streaks are a form of consistency). Per user decision, use existing categories.

    3. Define Form Master badge instances. Per user decision: "Bronze/Silver/Gold based on streak length or quality threshold". Claude's discretion on exact thresholds:
       - FORM_MASTER_BRONZE: QualityStreak(sets=3, minScore=85) -- 3 consecutive sets above 85
       - FORM_MASTER_SILVER: QualityStreak(sets=5, minScore=85) -- 5 consecutive sets above 85
       - FORM_MASTER_GOLD: QualityStreak(sets=10, minScore=90) -- 10 consecutive sets above 90

    4. Add getProgressDescription and getTargetValue handling for QualityStreak in Badge class:
       - getProgressDescription: "$currentValue/${req.sets} sets (>${req.minScore})"
       - getTargetValue: req.sets

    5. Create a companion object or top-level val holding the Form Master badges list. Follow whatever pattern the existing badge definitions use (check if there's a BadgeRegistry or similar).

    6. NOTE: Badge EARNING logic (tracking consecutive set quality) is NOT in this task. This task only defines the badge models. Earning logic requires integration with GamificationManager which is a separate concern and can be wired when the full gamification flow is connected. The badge definitions must exist for the UI to reference them.

    7. Per GATE-02 and user decision: badges are "visible only to Phoenix+ tier users". The gating will be enforced at the UI layer (badge display checks FeatureGate), not in the model definitions.
