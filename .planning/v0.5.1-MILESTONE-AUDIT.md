# Milestone v0.5.1 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v0.5.1 Board Polish & Premium UI
**Audited:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** GAPS FOUND
**Scope:** Phases 16-22 (7 phases, 26 requirements)

## Executive Summary

Milestone v0.5.1 is **29% through execution** (2 of 7 phases complete). The two completed phases (16: Foundation & Board Conditions, 17: WCAG Accessibility) passed their individual phase verifications. However, 5 phases (18-22) have not been planned or executed, leaving 18 requirements unsatisfied. The integration checker also found 3 hardcoded semantic colors missed in Phase 17's composable retrofit, making BOARD-02 partially unsatisfied.

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Plans | Status | Verification |
|-------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 16 | Foundation & Board Conditions | 2/2 | ✓ Complete | Passed (8/8) |
| 17 | WCAG Accessibility | 2/2 | ✓ Complete | Passed (8/8) |
| 18 | HUD Customization | 0/TBD | ○ Not started | Missing |
| 19 | CV Form Check UX & Persistence | 0/TBD | ○ Not started | Missing |
| 20 | Readiness Briefing | 0/TBD | ○ Not started | Missing |
| 21 | RPG Attributes | 0/TBD | ○ Not started | Missing |
| 22 | Ghost Racing | 0/TBD | ○ Not started | Missing |

## Requirements Coverage

### Satisfied (7/26)

| Requirement | Phase | Description | Evidence |
|-------------|-------|-------------|---------|
| BOARD-01 | 16 | SmartSuggestions local timezone | classifyTimeWindow() uses Instant + toLocalDateTime(timeZone); 3 timezone tests |
| BOARD-03 | 16 | Backup exclusion rules | backup_rules.xml + data_extraction_rules.xml; AndroidManifest references both |
| BOARD-05 | 16 | Camera permission rationale | "Camera needed for Form Check. All processing stays on your device." |
| BOARD-06 | 16 | iOS PHOENIX suppression | isIosPlatform expect/actual; no existing UI lists Form Check for iOS |
| BOARD-07 | 16 | versionName reflects actual version | versionName = "0.5.1" in build.gradle.kts |
| BOARD-08 | 16 | PoseLandmarker graceful error | try-catch in setupPoseLandmarker() with user-facing error message |
| BOARD-09 | 16 | FeatureGate entries with correct tiers | CV_FORM_CHECK, RPG_ATTRIBUTES, GHOST_RACING (Phoenix), READINESS_BRIEFING (Elite) |

### Partial (1/26)

| Requirement | Phase | Issue |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| BOARD-02 | 17 | Phase verification passed (8/8 truths), but integration checker found 3 hardcoded semantic colors in SmartInsightsTab.kt (lines 295, 361, 362) that bypass AccessibilityTheme in color-blind mode |

### Unsatisfied (18/26)

| Requirement | Phase | Reason |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| BOARD-04 | 18 | Phase not started — HUD customization |
| CV-01 | 19 | Phase not started — Form Check toggle UI |
| CV-04 | 19 | Phase not started — Real-time form warnings |
| CV-05 | 19 | Phase not started — Form score calculation |
| CV-06 | 19 | Phase not started — Form data persistence |
| CV-10 | 19 | Phase not started — iOS "coming soon" message |
| GHOST-01 | 22 | Phase not started — Ghost racing matching |
| GHOST-02 | 22 | Phase not started — Dual progress bars |
| GHOST-03 | 22 | Phase not started — Per-rep verdict |
| GHOST-04 | 22 | Phase not started — End-of-set delta summary |
| RPG-01 | 21 | Phase not started — Five attribute computation |
| RPG-02 | 21 | Phase not started — Character class assignment |
| RPG-03 | 21 | Phase not started — Attribute card UI |
| RPG-04 | 21 | Phase not started — Portal deep link |
| BRIEF-01 | 20 | Phase not started — ACWR readiness heuristic |
| BRIEF-02 | 20 | Phase not started — Pre-workout briefing card |
| BRIEF-03 | 20 | Phase not started — Advisory-only (no blocking) |
| BRIEF-04 | 20 | Phase not started — Portal upsell link |

## Integration Report

### Cross-Phase Wiring (Phases 16-17)

| Category | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Connected exports | 13/14 |
| Orphaned exports | 1 (isIosPlatform — intentionally deferred to Phase 19) |
| Broken flows | 0 |
| E2E flows verified | 4/4 |

### Integration Defect

**SmartInsightsTab.kt — 3 missed semantic colors (BOARD-02)**

| Line | Hardcoded Color | Should Be |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| 295 | `Color(0xFFF59E0B)` (warning amber) | `AccessibilityTheme.colors.warning` |
| 361 | `Color(0xFFF97316)` (urgency orange) | `AccessibilityTheme.colors.warning` or `colors.error` |
| 362 | `Color(0xFFEAB308)` (recency yellow) | `AccessibilityTheme.colors.statusYellow` |

These 3 indicators in SmartInsightsTab do not switch to the deuteranopia palette when color-blind mode is enabled.

## Tech Debt

### Phase 16: Foundation & Board Conditions
- Dead `showRationale` variable in `FormCheckOverlay.android.kt` (info — functionally correct)
- `DeviceInfo.android.kt` reads `Constants.APP_VERSION` not `PackageInfo.versionName` — latent divergence risk

### Phase 17: WCAG Accessibility
- 3 residual hardcoded semantic colors in `SmartInsightsTab.kt` (integration defect, not caught by phase verifier)

### Total: 3 items across 2 phases
