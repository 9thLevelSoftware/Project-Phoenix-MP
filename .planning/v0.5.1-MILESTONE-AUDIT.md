### Unsatisfied (8/26) — Phases Not Started

## Cross-Phase Integration (Phases 16-20)

**Score:** 17/18 wiring points verified | 5/5 E2E flows complete | 1 minor integration gap

### Verified Connections

1. Phase 16 `FeatureGate` entries → Phase 19 CV_FORM_CHECK gating (via SubscriptionManager) ✓
2. Phase 16 `FeatureGate` entries → Phase 20 READINESS_BRIEFING gating (via SubscriptionManager) ✓
3. Phase 16 `isIosPlatform` → Phase 19 iOS coming-soon dialog ✓
4. Phase 17 `AccessibilityTheme.colors` → Phase 19 FormCheckOverlay ✓
5. Phase 17 `AccessibilityTheme.colors` → Phase 20 ReadinessBriefingCard (statusGreen/Yellow/Red) ✓
6. Phase 17 `velocityZoneColor()/velocityZoneLabel()` → WorkoutHud, SetSummaryCard ✓
7. Phase 18 `HudPreset` → WorkoutHud dynamic pager filtering ✓
8. Phase 18 `hudPreset` preference pipeline → Settings → MainViewModel → ActiveWorkoutScreen ✓
9. Phase 19 `ExerciseFormType.fromExerciseName()` → WorkoutHud → FormCheckOverlay ✓
10. Phase 19 `formScore` → ActiveSessionEngine → DB persistence → SetSummaryCard ✓
11. Phase 20 `ReadinessEngine.computeReadiness()` → ActiveWorkoutScreen LaunchedEffect ✓
12. Phase 20 `ReadinessBriefingCard` → ActiveWorkoutScreen Elite-gated rendering ✓
13. ActiveWorkoutScreen integrates HUD preset + Form Check + Readiness Card without conflict ✓

### Integration Gap

**FormWarningBanner.kt** (Phase 19) does not consume `AccessibilityTheme.colors` for severity colors — uses hardcoded Material3 `errorContainer`/`tertiaryContainer`. Phase 17 mandated all new composables (Phases 18-22) use `AccessibilityTheme`. WCAG 1.4.1 letter is met (icon+text present), but Phase 17 spirit is not. Affected: BOARD-02 (minor).

### Progress Since Previous Audit

| Item | Previous (04:15) | Current (17:30) |
|------|------------------|-----------------|
| Requirements satisfied | 8/26 | 18/26 (+10) |
| Phases complete | 3/7 | 5/7 (+2) |
| Integration score | 14/14 | 17/18 |
| E2E flows | 4/4 | 5/5 (+1) |
| SmartInsightsTab defect (BOARD-02) | partial | resolved (Phase 17 re-verification) |
| isIosPlatform forward-looking | unused | consumed by Phase 19 (CV-10) |
| FeatureGate entries forward-looking | unused | consumed by Phases 19 + 20 |

## E2E Flow Traces

| # | Flow | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Form Check enable → assessment → form score → persistence (Android, Phoenix+) | ✓ Complete |
| 2 | iOS Form Check toggle → coming-soon dialog | ✓ Complete |
| 3 | Elite user → readiness card → dismiss → workout starts | ✓ Complete |
| 4 | HUD preset change → pager filtering → persistence | ✓ Complete |
| 5 | Color-blind mode toggle → palette swap → all composables | ✓ Complete |

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 16 | `showRationale` dead variable in FormCheckOverlay.android.kt | Info |
| 19 | FormWarningBanner uses Material3 containers instead of AccessibilityTheme | Minor |
| 20 | Portal deep link callback placeholder `onPortalLink = {}` (PORTAL-03 deferred) | Info |
| Pre-existing | FeatureGate.isEnabled() not called at runtime (indirect via SubscriptionManager) | Info |

**Total:** 4 items across 4 categories (1 Minor, 3 Info)

## Human Verification Outstanding

15 human verification tests pending across 5 phases — all require on-device execution:
- Phase 16: 3 items (Settings version, camera rationale flow, PoseLandmarker missing asset)
- Phase 17: 4 items (color-blind toggle live, velocity zone labels, BalanceBar extreme values, persistence)
- Phase 18: 3 items (SegmentedButton visual, pager page count, preference persistence)
- Phase 19: 4 items (camera PiP, iOS dialog, FREE tier absence, E2E form check on device)
- Phase 20: 4 items (traffic-light card, InsufficientData card, dismiss lifecycle, non-blocking)

## Conclusion

v0.5.1 has completed its **Board of Directors conditions** (9/9 BOARD requirements) and three **premium UI features** (CV Form Check UX, Readiness Briefing). Two premium features remain unbuilt: **RPG Attributes** (Phase 21) and **Ghost Racing** (Phase 22), leaving 8 requirements unsatisfied.

The completed work is high quality: all 5 phases passed verification with 53/53 must-haves verified. Cross-phase integration is strong (17/18 connected). All 5 E2E flows trace end-to-end. Tech debt is minimal (4 items, only 1 minor).
